# Exercise 7: Debugging and Profiling

## Debugging

1. Install [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically.

## Profiling

1. [Here](/static/files/sorts.py) are some sorting algorithm implementations. Use [`cProfile`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html) and [`line_profiler`](https://github.com/rkern/line_profiler) to compare the runtime of insertion sort and quicksort. What is the bottleneck of each algorithm? Use then `memory_profiler` to check the memory consumption, why is insertion sort better? Check now the inplace version of quicksort. Challenge: Use `perf` to look at the cycle counts and cache hits and misses of each algorithm.

    **Solution**
    ```bash
    # Using `cProfile`
    python -m cProfile -s tottime sorts.py 1000

    # Using `line_profiler`
    # Add @profile in sort.py
    kernprof -l -v sorts.py

    # Using `memory_profiler`
    python -m memory_profiler sorts.py
    ```
    
2. Here's some (arguably convoluted) Python code for computing Fibonacci numbers using a function for each number.

   ```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python
   def fib0(): return 0

   def fib1(): return 1

   s = """def fib{}(): return fib{}() + fib{}()"""

   if __name__ == '__main__':

       for n in range(2, 10):
           exec(s.format(n, n-1, n-2))
       # from functools import lru_cache
       # for n in range(10):
       #     exec("fib{} = lru_cache(1)(fib{})".format(n, n))
       print(eval("fib9()"))
   ```

   Put the code into a file and make it executable. Install [`pycallgraph`](http://pycallgraph.slowchop.com/en/master/). Run the code as is with `pycallgraph graphviz -- ./fib.py` and check the `pycallgraph.png` file. How many times is `fib0` called?. We can do better than that by memoizing the functions. Uncomment the commented lines and regenerate the images. How many times are we calling each `fibN` function now?

3. A common issue is that a port you want to listen on is already taken by another process. Let's learn how to discover that process pid. First execute `python -m http.server 4444` to start a minimal web server listening on port `4444`. On a separate terminal run `lsof | grep LISTEN` to print all listening processes and ports. Find that process pid and terminate it by running `kill <PID>`.
    
    **Solution**
    ```bash
    lsof | grep LISTEN
    kill 568
    python -m http.server 4444
    ```
